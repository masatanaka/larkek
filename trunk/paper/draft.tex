We have collected 
J-PARC K1.1Br beamline

This paper describes a study of particle identification performance of
liquid Argon TPC (LArTPC) detector using well-defined charged particles
(pions, kaons, and protons) with momentum of ~800 MeV/$c$
obtained at J-PARC K1.1Br beamline.

We have build a LArTPC detector with fiducial mass of ~150 kg,
and injected the beam particle

\subsection{Collected Data}

Table~\ref{Table:Data} shows list of the collected data while Oct/2010 Run.
800 MeV/$c$ pion is expected to pass-through the detector as MIP,
and have uniform energy deposition to all the TPC channels.
So this data set is very useful for calibrating the detector response (See section xxx).
800 MeV/$c$ proton stops after ~15 cm of flight distance inside the TPC fiducial volume
with relatively large $dE/dx$. So we use the proton data set for validation of the
detector response at high $dE/dx$ region(See section xxx).
We have collected three different Kaon data by varying thickness of the degrader. 
540, 630, 680 MeV/$c$ are corresponds to the momentum degraded by 
2 lead glass, 1 lead glass + 1 lead block, and 1 lead glass, respectively, 
and such Kaon stops after 10 cm, 50 cm, and 65 cm of flight distance inside TPC fiducial volume.

Figure~\ref{Fig:Textbook} shows an 2D display of typical event 
taken with 800 MeV/$c$ electron trigger.
Horizontal axis corresponds to TPC channel number 
and zero means most upper stream strip. 
Since strip pitch is 1 cm, this is equivalent to
distance from beam injection point in cm.
Vertical axis corresponds to electron drift time in $\mu$s
and t=0 means trigger timing. In this TPC, anode and cathode is
located at top and bottom of the detector, respectively,
t=0 means energy deposition at anode and longer drift time 
means energy deposition in lower height.
With 200 V/cm of electric field, drift velocity is about 0.8 m/ms.
So drift of full detector (40 cm) takes 500 $\mu$s.
Color strength of the plot corresponds to the TPC signal pulse height
in ADC counts which is roughly proportional to $dE/dx$ of the track.
In this event, triggered electron can be clearly seen center of the detector
as an electromagnetic shower while there are two other particles 
accidentally overlapped with the triggered electron. 
Track at t=100 $\mu$s is considered as
a proton which stops after 15 cm of flight distance and 
has large $dE/dx$ around the stopped point.
Track at t=400 $\mu$s is considered as
a pion which passes-through the detector and 
has uniform $dE/dx$ over the TPC channels.
This event already gives us some idea for how good 
the particle identification performance of the LArTPC is.

Figure~\ref{Fig:Kmunu} shows a typical $K \to\mu\nu$ like event.
We can clearly identify a kink of the track at 60 cm which is considered
as stopped point of Kaon and it decays to  

Energy deposition of the track is about MIP at the injection point
and gradually increase towards the stopped point at 60 cm.

 As described in section xx, we have several beam counters
to identify beam particles event by event

By using these counter information,

\section{Event Reconstruction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Noise Reduction}

Figure \ref{Fig:beforeFFT} shows raw waveform of the TPC signal
before applying any noise reduction. Two waveforms shown in this plot
are channel 13 and 37 in Figure~\ref{Fig:Textbook} which are roughly
proton stopped point and electron shower maximum point, respectively.
Signal-to-noise ratio for this particular case is poor and pion signal 
which is supposed to be t=400 $\mu$s is almost hidden by the noise. 
While time width of TPC signal is few $\mu$s which is determined by
drift time between anode and anode-grid, dominant noise component looks
higher frequency. To reduce such noises, we have applied FFT 
(Fast Flourier Transformation) filter to cut the high frequency component.
Figure \ref{Fig:FFT} shows amplitude as a function of frequency
for the same event. This clearly shows dominant noise component with
$>$ 200 kHz has good separation with signal component ($<$ 100 kHz).
Figure \ref{Fig:afterFFT} shows the waveform after removing high frequency
($>$ 80 kHz) component by the FFT filter. Signal-to-noise ratio is dramatically
improved. On the other hand, we expect certain bias to the signal charge
measurement by this filter, and it will be discussed in Section x.

\section{Liquid Argon Purity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Attenuation of the drift electron depends on purity of liquid Argon.
So we need to apply correction to TPC signal charge depends on the drift time.
We use cosmic ray sample for measuring the liquid Argon purity,
and use this to correct the beam data.

Figure~{fig:CosmicEvent} shows an event display of typical cosmic muon event.
Figure~{fig:CosmicPurity} shows an drift electron lifetime as a function of
duration after initial filling.
Drift electron lifetime was 600 $\mu$s at 60 hours, and 400 $\mu$s after 150 hours.
Initial purity looks good, but the purity was slowly degrading
while data taking period.

\section{Detector Simulation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Geant3, recombination, drift velocity}

We use GEANT3 for simulating energy deposition of beam particles and
their daughters. Readout pitch is 1 cm, 

we set the maximum step of Geant to 0.5 mm
which is enough smaller than the readout pitch of 1 cm.

It means charge deposition in one strip is typically 
simulated with 20 GEANT steps.

We set energy cut-off for soft electron/photon emission to
10 keV which is minimum possible energy can be set in GEANT3.
This cut-off is very important for  ionization electron recombination.

Recombination of electron and Argon ion depends on
the electric field and $dE/dx$. We use a measurement in Ref.\cite{658352}.
\begin{equation}
Q = A \frac{Q_0}{1 + k dE/dx}, A = 0.800, k = 0.486
\end{equation}

Velocity of the drift electron depends on the liquid Argon temperature
and the electric field. We use a measurement in Ref \cite{649233}.
