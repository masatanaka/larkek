\subsection{Hit Finding/Clustering}
After noise reduction we find signal hits and create clusters associated to single tracks. 
Hit is defined as bump over given threshold in a channel. 
After finding all hits in an event, we construct cluster by merging adjacent hits. 
The example of hit finding and clustering is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Clustering}, which indicates reasonable hit and cluster findings. 
Threshold of hit finding is six for our analysis. Monte Carlo simulation shows 99.8\% and 81.8\% hit finding efficiencies for Kaon and decayed muon hits, respectively. 
Average noise hits are about 7.5 in an event.
