\subsection{Hit Finding/Clustering}
After noise reduction we find signal hits and create clusters associated to single tracks. 
Hit is defined as bump over given threshold in a channel. 
After finding all hits in an event, we construct cluster by merging adjacent hits. 
The example of hit finding and clustering is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Clustering}, which indicates reasonable hit and cluster findings. 
Threshold of hit finding is determined to keep enough signal hit finding efficiency from simulation while keeping adequately small number of noise hits from real data.
