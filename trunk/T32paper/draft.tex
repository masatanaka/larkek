%% Text of abstract

This paper describes a study of particle identification performance of
liquid Argon TPC (LArTPC) detector using well-defined charged particles
(pions, kaons, and protons) with momentum of ~800 MeV/$c$
obtained at J-PARC K1.1Br beamline.

We have build a LArTPC detector with fiducial mass of ~150 kg,
and injected the beam particle
