\subsection{Noise Reduction}

Dotted line in Fig.~\ref{Fig:beforeafterFFT} shows raw waveform of the TPC signal
before applying any noise reduction. the waveform shown in this plot
are channel 13 in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Textbook} which are around the proton stopped point.
Signal-to-noise ratio for this particular case is poor and pion signal 
which is supposed to be t=400 $\mu$s is almost hidden by the noise. 
While time width of TPC signal is few $\mu$s which is determined by
drift time between anode and anode-grid, dominant noise component looks
higher frequency. To reduce such noises, we have applied FFT 
(Fast Flourier Transformation) filter to cut the high frequency component.
Figure \ref{Fig:FFT} shows amplitude as a function of frequency
for the same event. This clearly shows dominant noise component with
$>$ 200 kHz has good separation with signal component ($<$ 100 kHz).
Solid line in Fig.~\ref{Fig:beforeafterFFT} shows waveform after removing high frequency
($>$ 80 kHz) component by the FFT filter. Signal-to-noise ratio is dramatically
improved. On the other hand, we expect certain bias to the signal charge
measurement by this filter, and it will be discussed in Section x.
