   \subsection{Beam Energy}
 
   30GeV proton beam hits to target T1 in Hadron hall.
   It generates many particles like kaon, pion, muon, electron, and
   so on.
   We take the particles that has 800MeV/c momentum from this beam by
   using D1 magnet.\\
   \ \ For this analysis, a beam momentum at BDC after passing through the
   K1.1Br beam line is required.
   We estimate a beam momentum using simple MC simulation.
   Figure \ref{K11Br_Beam_line} shows MC simulation's geometory.
   This time, beam line is straight and has no electric and magnetic
   field.
   MC simulation shoot 800MeV/c kaon and pion as pencil beam.

   Figure \ref{k_pi_momentum} shows kaon and pion momentum distribution
   using this MC simulation.
   Actually, kaon momentum distribution peak is adjusted so that kaon
   decay point of MC simulation is consistent with data.
   Section \ref{kaon_energy_section} explains this point.
   And proton momentum is estimated in other way, using TREK detector
   TOF information.
   Section \ref{proton_energy_section} shows proton momentum distribution.

   \subsubsection{Kaon energy}\label{kaon_energy_section}

We adjust momentum peak of figure ?? and set Kaon beam energy  the point that the decay points of Kaon in data and simulation are good agreement. The distribution of decay poins are plotted in Figure\ref{DecayPoint_hough}.

   \subsubsection{Proton energy}\label{proton_energy_section}

Figure\ref{fig:Proton_tof} shows responce of the TOF Counters of selected Proton of Run 49 which includes many proton events.
Compared the value of 17.98ns of table\ref{tb:TOF_expect},
protons are distributed where is much smaller than this value.
This result indicates beam momentum of protons are smaller than $\sim$800MeV.
Futhermore, the dispersion of time of flight of protons is very differnt from the other particles.
Based on these fact, the momentum of Proton which implement in simulation
is estimated by TOF information.
Figure\ref{fig:Proton_momentum} shows the estimated momentum from time of flight between two TOF Counters.
Whether the distribution reproduce real momentum well is discussed in section 7.2.\\

   \subsubsection{Energy deposition in degrader}
   Because of having high energy, kaon beam from BDC passes through 250LAr TPC.
   So that kaon stops in 250LAr TPC, we put degrader, which reduce
   beam energy, on beam line.
   In this experiment, we used lead glass and lead block as degrader.
   We estimate energy deposition in degrader by using MC simulation.
   Figure \ref{energy_deposition} shows energy deposition in degrader.
   
   \subsection{Beam Position}
   Before taking data, we measured a beam profile on the front of
   250LAr TPC by using plastic scintillation counter.
   Figure \ref{beamprofile_250L} shows beam profile on the front of
   250LAr TPC.
