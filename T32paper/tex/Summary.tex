\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have constructed 250L LArTPC
\item Collected high purity Pion, Kaon, and proton sample
\item Establish Kaon stopped point finding algorithm
\item Develop realistic detector simulation
\item Good understanding of Pion Landau distribution
\item Good understanding of Proton and Kaon dE/dx
\item Measurement of recombination using pi, K, and proton
\end{itemize}
