\subsection{Hit Finding/Clustering}
After noise reduction we find signal hits and create clusters associated to single tracks. 
Hit is defined as bump over given threshold in a channel. 
After finding all hits in an event, we construct cluster by merging adjacent hits. 
The example of hit finding and clustering is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:Clustering}, which indicates reasonable hit and cluster findings. 
Threshold of hit finding is 6 ADC counts, which is about 2.5$\sigma$ from typical data noise level (as shown in Fig~\ref{Fig:beforeFFT}) and keeping more than 99\% of Kaon hit finding efficiency from simulation.
% noise level from outside window of PhysicsOct55 (rms~2.49)
ADC count distribution is fitted by step funcion plus Gaussian to estimate the charge of hit in ADC $\times$ $\mu$s unit.
Fitting $\chi^2 < 3$ and $2.5<$~(time~width~of~hit)~$<8$~$\mu$s are required to remove noise hits further.
