\subsection{Geant3, recombination, drift velocity}

We use GEANT3 for simulating energy deposition of initial beam particles and
secondary particles to LArTPC detector and beamline counters. 

we set the maximum step of Geant to 0.5 mm
which is enough smaller than the readout pitch of 1 cm.
It means charge deposition in one strip is typically 
simulated with 20 GEANT steps.

We set energy cut-off for soft electron/photon emission to
10 keV which is minimum possible energy can be set in GEANT3.
This cut-off is very important for ionization electron recombination.

Recombination of electron and Argon ion depends on
the electric field and $dE/dx$. We use a measurement in Ref.\cite{658352}.
\begin{equation}
Q = A \frac{Q_0}{1 + k dE/dx}, A = 0.800, k = 0.486
\end{equation}

Velocity of the drift electron depends on the liquid Argon temperature
and the electric field. We use a measurement in Ref \cite{649233}.

\subsection{Electric Field}

Electric field of the TPC field cage
We have calculated the electric field using a 2D FEM (Finite Element Method) package \cite{Ref:FEMTET}.

This field map is used for simulating electron drift.
