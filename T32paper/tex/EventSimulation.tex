\section{Event Simulation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Event simulated with the following step
\begin{itemize}
\item Physics process and energy deposition of the beam particles (GEANT3)
\item Conversion of the energy deposition to number of the ionization electrons
\item Drift of the ionization electrons from the point of energy deposition to Anode plane
\item Preamp response, and digitization
\item Noise
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Energy Deposition in TPC}

We use GEANT3 for simulating energy deposition of initial beam particles and
secondary particles to the TPC detector and beam line counters. 
Maximum step of GEANT is set to 0.5 mm which is enough smaller than the TPC readout pitch of 1 cm,
and it means charge deposition in one strip is simulated with more 20 GEANT steps.
We set energy cut-off for soft electron/photon emission to
10 keV which is minimum possible energy can be set in GEANT3.
This cut-off is important for ionization electron recombination.

\subsection{Electric Field}

Figure~\ref{Fit:2DFieldMap} shows electric field of the TPC in V/cm which is calculated using a 2D FEM 
(Finite Element Method) package \cite{Ref:FEMTET},
where horizontal axis, vertical axis, and color strength 
correspond to the beam line direction, the drift direction, the electric field in V/cm, respectively.
Cathode, Anode, and Anode grid are located at of z=-200 mm, z=200 mm, and z=210 mm. respectively.
There are significant distortion of the electric field around 4 corners of the TPC fiducial volume,
and also around x=$\pm$120 mm where support structure of the Cathode and Anode grids exists.

\subsection{Drift Electron Simulation}

Recombination of electron and Argon ion depends on
the electric field $E$ and $dE/dx$,
\begin{equation}
  Q = A\frac{Q_{0}}{1+(k/E)\times(dE/dx)\times(1/\rho)}
\end{equation}
where $Q_{0}$ is initial ionization charge which is obtained from GEANT, $\rho$ is density of liquid Argon (=1.4 g/cm$^3$).
For $A$ and $k$, we use the measurement by ICARUS collaboration \cite{658352}.

After the recombination, drift of the ionization electrons is simulated
using a step simulation with step size of 0.1 mm.
Drift velocity of the ionization electron depends on the liquid Argon temperature
and the electric field. We use a measurement by ICARUS collaboration \cite{649233}.
Typical drift velocity with 200 V/cm of the drift field and temperature of 92K is 0.8 m/ms.
Diffusion of the drift electron is considered and we assume size of the transverse diffusion and and lateral diffusion
are 3.0 mm/m and 1.5 mm/m, respectively.
Figure~\ref{Fig:DriftSimulation} shows simulated track of the drift electrons with three different positions.
left plot with x= 0 mm corresponds to the center of the TPC detector, 
middle plot with x= 130 mm corresponds to the location of anode grid frame,
and right plot with x= 350 mm corresponds to the edge of the TPC fiducial.
Because of the field distortion we find significant displacement of the drift electron in
x direction for x=130 and x=350. It is a main source of the non-uniformity observed in 
the through-going pion response (Fig.~\ref{fig:PionQvsCh}).
