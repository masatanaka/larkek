\subsection{Stopped Kaon}
Hough transform was invented for machine analysis of bubble chamber photographs by Paul.V.C.Hough.\cite{3069654}
We detect straight lines using hough method , and find Kaon stopped point from the intersection of straight lines.\\
Figure \ref{hmap2} shows hit map like a Kaon track.
One point in the X-Y space can be transformed into sinusoidal curve in the $\rho$-$\theta$ space.Figure \ref{rho_theta2} shows sinusoidal curves in all points.
And, we detect the straight line associated with the largest number of points by choosing the most dense point in $\rho$-$\theta$ space.
Next , the sinusoidal curves of the hits associated with frist straight line are removed from figure \ref{rho_theta2}.
Figure \ref{rho_theta3} shows sinusoidal curves after the hits associated with frist straight line removed.
We detect second straight line using the same procedure.This procedure is repeated until there are less than three points.Figure \ref{hmap_fit} shows the two straight lines detected by hough transform mehotd.\\
Kaon stopped point in the liquid argon detecor defined as charge maximum point around the intersection of some lines.

\subsubsection{Chi2 method}
$\chi^{2}$ method is the algorithm that search the point of rapidly increasing fit'$\chi^{2}$ and the point defined as the stopped point.
Because the charged particle coming from upsteam of beam line , track reconstruction is started from minimum channel  to the maximum channel of the cluster.\\
Figure \ref{hmap3} shows hit map like a Kaon track.
We start fitting with straight line from minimum channel to maximum channel.Figure \ref{xvschi} shows range vs fit'$\chi^{2}$ distribution.
As it can be noiced for figure \ref{xvschi}, $\chi^{2}$ is increased rapidly if the straight line is strayed out.
Then , we search the strayed point from the straight line by setting reasonable threhold and draw from minimum channel to the strayed point.
This procedure is done from maximum channel to minimum channel in the same way.
And we draw from maximum channel to the strayed point.
Kaon stopped point in the liquid argon detecor defined as charge maximum point around the intersection of two lines.

\subsubsection{BS method}
In the $\chi^{2}$ method , we can't detect Kaon stopped point in the case of backward decay.
Then , we detect Kaon stopped point using BS method.\\ 
BS method is concept that the Kaon stopped point defined as lightmost channel in the case of backward decay.
we descript below how the track defined as backward decay.
$N_{1}$ is defined as Number of cluster hits found by the clustering.
Stopped point finding is started from minimum channel.
We search for the closet timing hit in next channel from current channel hit. 
Then , we repeat this procedure until maximum channel and count the number of selected hit information($N_{2}$).
In the case of backward decay , $N_{1}$ is larger than $N{2}$.
So , we set reasonable threhold of the difference between $N_{1}$ and $N{2}$ , and if the $N_{1}>N_{2}$ is over the threshold , the track is defined as backward decay.
In the case of backward decay , we defined charge maximum point around the maximum channel as the stopped point.
