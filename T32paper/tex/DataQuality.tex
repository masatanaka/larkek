\subsection{Collected Data}

Table~\ref{Table:Data} shows list of the collected data while Oct/2010 Run.
800 MeV/$c$ pion is expected to pass-through the detector as MIP,
and have uniform energy deposition to all the TPC channels.
So this data set is very useful for calibrating the detector response (See section xxx).
800 MeV/$c$ proton stops after ~15 cm of flight distance inside the TPC fiducial volume
with relatively large $dE/dx$. So we use the proton data set for validation of the
detector response at high $dE/dx$ region(See section xxx).
We have collected three different Kaon data by varying thickness of the degrader. 
540, 630, 680 MeV/$c$ are corresponds to the momentum degraded by 
2 lead glass, 1 lead glass + 1 lead block, and 1 lead glass, respectively, 
and such Kaon stops after 10 cm, 50 cm, and 65 cm of flight distance inside TPC fiducial volume.

Figure~\ref{Fig:Textbook} shows an 2D display of typical event 
taken with 800 MeV/$c$ electron trigger.
Horizontal axis corresponds to TPC channel number 
and zero means most upper stream strip. 
Since strip pitch is 1 cm, this is equivalent to
distance from beam injection point in cm.
Vertical axis corresponds to electron drift time in $\mu$s
and t=0 means trigger timing. In this TPC, anode and cathode is
located at top and bottom of the detector, respectively,
t=0 means energy deposition at anode and longer drift time 
means energy deposition in lower height.
With 200 V/cm of electric field, drift velocity is about 0.8 m/ms.
So drift of full detector (40 cm) takes 500 $\mu$s.
Color strength of the plot corresponds to the TPC signal pulse height
in ADC counts which is roughly proportional to $dE/dx$ of the track.
In this event, triggered electron can be clearly seen center of the detector
as an electromagnetic shower while there are two other particles 
accidentally overlapped with the triggered electron. 
Track at t=100 $\mu$s is considered as
a proton which stops after 15 cm of flight distance and 
has large $dE/dx$ around the stopped point.
Track at t=400 $\mu$s is considered as
a pion which passes-through the detector and 
has uniform $dE/dx$ over the TPC channels.
This event already gives us some idea for how good 
the particle identification performance of the LArTPC is.

Figure~\ref{Fig:Kmunu} shows a typical $K \to\mu\nu$ like event.
We can clearly identify a kink of the track at 60 cm which is considered
as stopped point of Kaon and it decays to  

Energy deposition of the track is about MIP at the injection point
and gradually increase towards the stopped point at 60 cm.

\item Plot: TOF before and after selection  (A. Okamoto)
\end{itemize}

 As described in section xx, we have several beam counters
to identify beam particles event by event
Figure~ref{fig:TREK} shows response of the, FC, GC, and TOF counters.
By using these counter information,
